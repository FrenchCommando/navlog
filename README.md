# Known issues - timesaver for next time

- `merge_pdf` messes up the annotations, so you should print the pdfs one by one
    - easier to keep track as well, if you print everything at once, you'll be overwhelmed
    - you have to attach your ScheduleD to your state return, so you'll print it twice

- when you sent it to `staples` or `fedex` or any other service,
  make sure you flatten your pdfs or the annotations won't print,
    - use `Microsoft print to pdf`
    - you can convert the annotations to read only, but it won't solve the issue

## More advice
- don't push your personal information
- ask for help if you don't know
